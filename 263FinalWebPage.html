   			<p>Mirror is a Peloton parallel product. Like Peloton’s bike and treadmill system, an equipment is needed for its online programs. It has its own professional coaches and allows the users to simultaneously watch the instructor and check out their own reflection. The users could monitor their own forms through the Mirror system.

        <p>In order to meet the urgent needs of people who want to workout at home and encourage other people to exercise during the pandemic, various systems helping achieve this goal emerge and become popular. They try to meet the needs of people at different ages, with different incomes and preferences.</p>
        <p>Both of the first two systems above need to purchase equipment and memberships. As to the low income people, such as students, it is not so friendly.
        <p>Equipment is a big investment with high risk, even the monthly payment would be a considerable expense. Bikes and treadmills will occupy a lot of space, and the Mirror is fragile which needs extra care during both storage and movement. In addition, interactivity within these two systems are limited. Enough encouragement from interactivity will make the user keep on their workout, otherwise they can give up easily. </p>
		<p>Another form of system which could help people workout at home but is cheap and more feasible is live workout instruction on Instagram.Ho

      </div>

      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>During the project, most of the time, our process went well. We put the collaboration plan into practice. The competitive analysis provided us with an overview of different approaches to design a fitness application. What’s more, we did a good job in user interviews since given our different backgrounds, every team member can focus on interviewing people that they’re familiar with. And the user research inspired us about what features we should include or not. After establishing the system, the evaluations provided us with a way to review and improve our system that makes it much more user-friendly.</p>
        <p>Besides, there are also some challenges we faced that are listed as follows: 1. Since we cannot reach out to those fitness trainers, we can only choose to focus on the fitness enthusiasts. It would be better if we can also take the fitness trainers' opinion into account. 2. After setting up the user stories, as there are so many features, it’s not easy to integrate them into an application even after prioritization. 3. After the mockup was established, it’s kind of time-consuming to make some changes on the user flow as our app is pretty deep.

      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>Firstly, we would like to thank Professor Matt for all the help and advice with our project. We also appreciate all the support we received from Agnes and Dennis. Besides, we would like to thank all the interviewees during the process that allowed us to conduct the user research and the user evaluation. Without them, this project would have not been possible. Finally, we want to thank all the teammates’ joint efforts that make this project from scratch to a final prototype. It was really a fantastic experience! </p>
